To help the beginner developer in need

This repository (account?) contains my "trial and error" attempts in my data science path. My current objective is to get a "self-taught degree", since the internet made learning such a hard subject much more easier, with tons of materials around every corner. The main problem for most people is to make a good path for themselves to actually accomplish something worthwhile.

Feel free to take a look around about my nice and not-so-nice accomplishments! Maybe I can inspire someone in my current state to grow their knowledge
